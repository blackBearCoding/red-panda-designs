          Hey there, I’m Delaney! </br>
Owner and Chief Creative at Red Panda Designs. </br></br>
When determining what I wanted to do for a living, I had two criteria: <span class="orange">love what I do and help people</span>. My passion for art and design started with my youthful doodles as a child. Since I could pick up a pencil, I’ve been an artist—art has always been a creative outlet that drives my purpose! </br></br>
So, after studying graphic design at Warren Technical School and completing a software development apprenticeship at Techtonic in Boulder, CO, I decided to take my art and tech skills and form a <span class="orange">multidisciplinary design agency</span> that helps small business owners bring their visions to life. 
Cue the beginning of Red Panda Designs!</br></br>
Art and design are innate parts of my being, a gift that I love sharing with my clients. Each project gives new meaning to my mission and I am <span class="orange">fueled by working</span> with so many unique individuals and imaginations daily! </br></br>
I believe that when dreaming up creative ideas, it’s so important to vibe with your designer! So, let’s get to know each other. Here are some fun facts about me:
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
&#8226; My family used to own the Telluride Valley Floor, so I grew up traipsing around some of the most incredible natural landscapes in the country. I think it fueled my love for beautiful things! </br></br>
&#8226; I am <span class="orange">ambidextrous</span>, which is a fancy way of saying I can do anything with either hand. This comes in super handy for an artist and designer since my hands are my most prized tools of the trade! </br></br>
&#8226; Creativity is always flowing through my veins. I love to perform on stage. Dancing, acting, singing—you name it, I love it. But I never said I was good at it… we’ll call it my passion project. </br></br>
&#8226; I have a secret superpower: ADHD. Now I guess the secret’s out, but I want to end the stigma around mental illness! ADHD fuels my <span class="orange">empathy</span>, makes me a super <span class="orange">passionate</span> human, and inspires <span class="orange">creative sparks</span> others don’t experience. It’s just part of what makes me who I am! 
Now, I want to learn more about you!
